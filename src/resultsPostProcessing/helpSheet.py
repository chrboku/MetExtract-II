"""
Generates the "help" sheet that documents the structure of the step 2 processing results
(the "<experiment>_grouped.xlsx" file produced by bracketing / re-integration / convolution /
annotation).

The sheet is a simple 3-column table (name, description, detailed_description) that is meant
to be human-readable directly in Excel. It is organized into sections (sheets overview, common
columns, annotation columns, sample-specific columns, and a detailed section for the database
annotation columns added to the "5_Annotated" sheet).

To extend this documentation (e.g. because a new sheet or column was added elsewhere in the
code), simply add a new entry to the appropriate list below (SHEET_DESCRIPTIONS,
COMMON_COLUMNS, ANNOTATION_COLUMNS, SAMPLE_COLUMNS or ANNOTATED_DATABASES_DETAIL) or register an
entirely new section by adding a tuple to SECTIONS.
